Bitch left me while I was locked up, I came home, I shitted on that bitch
Went silly on that bitch, got diamonds drippin' off my wrist
If you ain't suckin' dick then I ain't interested, bitch
You got a deep throat, lick on and spit on my shit
I got a bag, niggas' savings, I be spendin' that shit
My homie turned state, now he a witness and shit
See, on my soul, I'm out here shootin' poles
I probably catch a body before I catch a cold

Hold on, hold on, hold—Run that shit back
This that OTF shit, this that Stretch Gang shit, this that GetBack Gang shit
Von, Von (DJ on the beat so it's a banger), Von

Bitch left me while I was locked up, I came home, I shitted on that bitch
Went silly on that bitch, got diamonds drippin' off my wrist
If you ain't suckin' dick then I ain't interested bitch
You got a deep throat, lick on and spit on my shit
I got a bag, niggas' savings, I be spendin' that shit
My homie turned state, now he a witness and shit
See, on my soul, I'm out here shootin' poles
I probably catch a body before I catch a cold

I got a shootin' folks habit, I know I'm too savage
My little bro packin', we team No Lackin
Better not get caught in traffic, 'cause I'm Stretch Gang crazy
My old ho is blue, I wouldn't fuck 'em if they paid me
Hermes, nah, bitch this Ferragamo
Ain't tryna fuck the nigga bitch, I'm tryna fuck his mama
I'm with a bad bitch named London, she gay and she swing both ways like nunchucks
My guys deep fry shit, Popeyes
Never lackin' stay on point, see everything like I'm cockeyed
Ho nigga got bitch ways, he switch sides
Change a nigga like a flat tire, he gon' need more than peroxide
Ooh, I know you feelin' this, boy this that killin' shit
This that gang only shit, you need a membership
This that hit your target shit, it hit your witness shit
You ain't see that boy in three days, that's that he missin' shit
Now, that's that fishy shit, but Von tote a 50 clip
Plus my gun been through some shit
Like Bernie Mac, bitch, who you with?
Balmain, nah, bitch I rock Amiris
My Drac' just caught two niggas back to back, it's gettin' scary

Bitch left me while I was locked up, I came home, I shitted on that bitch
Went silly on that bitch, got diamonds drippin' off my wrist
If you ain't suckin' dick, then I ain't interested bitch
You got a deep throat, lick on and spit on my shit
I got a bag, niggas' savings, I be spendin' that shit
My homie turned state, now he a witness and shit
See on my soul, I'm out here shootin' poles
I probably catch a body before I catch a cold
