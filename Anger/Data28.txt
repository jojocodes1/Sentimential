Get the fuck out
Did I fucking stutter?
I said get the fuck out
Bouncing from bed to bed
This isn't for pretend I'm done
The end
I'll never give a fuck again
Let me explain just how much this means to me
I'm not the same
I'm insane
And you're a fucking waste
Lets get it straight
Close your legs
You are everything I hate
Confess your love to me?
You were just fucking me
Our love was fake
How'd it taste?
When I spit right in your face
I put my trust in you
But you just fucked that too
In love with
A two faced bitch
How the fuck did I kiss
Your cum dripping lips
Get the fuck out
Look me in the eyes
I said get the fuck out
Lets get it straight
Close your legs
You are everything I hate
Confess your love to me?
You were just fucking me
Our love was fake
How'd it taste?
When I spit right in your face
I put my trust in you
But you just fucked that too
You just fucked that too
Don't wanna see your face
Don't wanna hear your voice
You stained my name
Now get the fuck away from me
Stare into to my eyes
Look at what you've to me
Severe our ties
The love I felt was fucking fake
So get the fuck out
I'm sick of all the lies you speak
And shut the fuck up
And never say a word to me
Lets get it straight
Close your legs
You are everything I hate
Confess your love to me?
You were just fucking me
Our love was fake
How'd it taste
When I spit right in your face
I put my trust in you
But you just fucked that too
Lets get it straight
Close your legs
You are everything I hate
Confess your love to me?
You were just fucking me
Our love was fake
How'd it taste
When I spit right in your face
I put my trust in you
But you just fucked that too
