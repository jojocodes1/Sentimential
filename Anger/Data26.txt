Deep in the willow
Hidden from grace
Succumb to insecurity
Your final resting place
Crafting your perfect world, ignoring total truth
You'll die alone
There's only room for you
Fuck you
True colors shown
And I'm not impressed
A king to none
Atop your throne, you will die alone
A king to none
Your greed lies deeper than blood
A king to none
Atop your throne, you will die alone
A king to none
Your greed lies deeper than blood
Deep in the willow, you sink alone
Don't lose your balance on the fence
You're only swimming up stream
Tail tucked for the world to see
Living your life playing on both teams
It all comes back around
The tables turn
A rat to most
To me less
True colors shown
And I'm not impressed
A king to none
Atop your throne, you will die alone
A king to none
Your greed lies deeper than blood
A king to none
A rat to most to me less
A king to none
And I'm not impressed
Knocked loose, motherfucker
Deep in the willow
