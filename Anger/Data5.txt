He was wealthy, fine, he was loved
He didn't have no problems at all
He was sharing, he was sweet with a heart full of love, that he kept passing around


He's a mad man
His eyes turned red when the lights go down
He'll kill you if he see in the gun-smoke town
He always smiled but up inside ain't no love to be found
He told me that he got some loved ones but i don't know how


You think i'm insane Don't you?
But I'm smart as hell
For a fact you don't know me
Why you think that they chose me?
For my benefits
So I feel like they owe me
Don't walk up on me
If you not around then you cannot control me
Starting to seem like every-time that i pick up my phone these lil' niggas clone me
I cut all them hoes off
Go n' ask them if they real, they'll tell you
That that lil nigga on now
Slime you down, huh
He don't care bout ya feelings
Fuck the sex, they profiling it's murder in the city
They say he ain't shit, he don't know nothing but killing
I can you name 3 victims
