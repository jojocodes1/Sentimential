I see you drivin' 'round town with the girl I love
And I'm like, "Fuck you" (ooh, ooh, ooh)
I guess the change in my pocket wasn't enough
I'm like, "Fuck you, and, uh, fuck her too"
Said if I was richer, I'd still be with ya
Ha, now ain't that some shit? (Ain't that some shit?)
And although there's pain in my chest, I still wish you the best
With a "Fuck you" (ooh, ooh, ooh)
Yeah, I'm sorry, I can't afford a Ferrari, huh
But that don't mean I can't get you there, huh
I guess he's an Xbox, and I'm more Atari, mmm
But the way you play your game ain't fair, uh
I pity the fool that falls in love with you, uh-oh

Ooh, I've got some news for you, uh-huh

I see you drivin' 'round town with the girl I love
And I'm like, "Fuck you" (ooh, ooh, ooh)
I guess the change in my pocket wasn't enough
I'm like, "Fuck you, and, uh, fuck her too"
Said if I was richer, I'd still be with ya
Ha, now ain't that some shit? (Ain't that some shit?)
And although there's pain in my chest, I still wish you the best
With a "Fuck you" (ooh, ooh, ooh)
Now I know, that I had to borrow, ha
Beg and steal, and lie and cheat
Tryin' to keep ya, tryin' to please ya
'Cause being in love with your ass ain't cheap, nah
I pity the fool that falls in love with you
(Oops, she's a gold-digger)
