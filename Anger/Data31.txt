Jealousy's an ugly word, but you don't seem to care
Converse behind my back, but now I'm here
Need no one to comply with me through everyone that I defeat
Don't need you, f- camaraderie, this rage will never go away
Hatred fuels my blood
I'll burn it down (you can't help me)
One king to watch the horsemen fall
I'll fight 'til the end (I won't help you)
I can't trust anyone
See it in my eyes
Now I can understand
It's sorrow that feeds your lies
Oh yeah
You're on my back when the water gets too deep for you to breath
A crutch for you that won't always be there
Hide in the dark another day, the fear in you is here to stay
So keep the f- away from me and learn to trust the words I say
Hatred fuels my blood
I'll burn it down (you can't help me)
One king to watch the horsemen fall
I'll fight 'til the end (I won't help you)
I can't trust anyone
Witness and see it in my eyes (whoa)
Now I can understand
Put faith in you for the last time
It's sorrow that feeds your lies
Yeah, yeah
Run from me before I tear you down (be afraid)
You chose the wrong side (it feels so right)
I won't help you, let you rot away, despise what you say (whoa)
Run towards the light exposing your soul
We won't be there by your side (whoa)
Salvation's dying (somebody's crying)
We're all gone in the end (whoa)
Sweet child, we'll miss you, whoa
So far away, far away
I can't trust anyone
Witness and see it in my eyes (whoa)
Now I can understand
Put faith in you for the last time
It's sorrow that feeds your lies
Falling away, can't buy back time
Burned it down anyways
