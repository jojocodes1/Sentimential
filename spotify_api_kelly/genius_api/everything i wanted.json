  "lyrics": "I had a dreamI got everything I wantedNot what you'd thinkAnd if I'm bein' honestIt might've been a nightmareTo anyone who might careThought I could fly (Fly)So I stepped off the Golden, mmNobody cried (Cried, cried, cried, cried)Nobody even noticedI saw them standing right thereKinda thought they might care (Might care, might care)I had a dreamI got everything I wantedBut when I wake up, I seeYou with meAnd you say, \"As long as I'm here, no one can hurt youDon't wanna lie here, but you can learn toIf I could change the way that you see yourselfYou wouldn't wonder why you hear'They don't deserve you'\"I tried to screamBut my head was underwaterThey called me weakLike I'm not just somebody's daughterCoulda been a nightmareBut it felt like they were right thereAnd it feels like yesterday was a year agoBut I don't wanna let anybody know'Cause everybody wants something from me nowAnd I don't wanna let 'em downI had a dreamI got everything I wantedBut when I wake up, I seeYou with meAnd you say, \"As long as I'm here, no one can hurt youDon't wanna lie here, but you can learn toIf I could change the way that you see yourselfYou wouldn't wonder why you hear'They don't deserve you'\"If I knew it all then, would I do it again?Would I do it again?If they knew what they said would go straight to my headWhat would they say instead?If I knew it all then, would I do it again?Would I do it again?If they knew what they said would go straight to my headWhat would they say instead?"
