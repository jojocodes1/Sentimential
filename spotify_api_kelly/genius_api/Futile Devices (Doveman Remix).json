  "lyrics": "It's been a long, long time since I've memorized your faceIt's been four hours now since I've wandered through your placeAnd when I sleep on your couch, I feel very safeAnd when you bring the blankets, I cover up my faceI do love youI do, ooh-ooh, love youAnd when you play guitar, I listen to the strings buzzThe metal vibrates underneath your fingersAnd when you crochet, I feel mesmerized and proudAnd I would say I love you, but saying it out loud is hardSo I won't say it at allAnd I won't stay very longBut you are the life I needed all alongI think of you as my brotherAlthough that sounds dumbAnd words are futile devices"
