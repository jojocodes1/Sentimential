  "lyrics": "Should've stayed, were there signs I ignored?Can I help you not to hurt anymore?We saw brilliance when the world was asleepThere are things that we can have but can't keepIf they sayWho cares if one more light goes out?In the sky of a million starsIt flickers, flickersWho cares when someone's time runs out?If a moment is all we areOr quicker, quickerWho cares if one more light goes out?Well, I doThe reminders pull the floor from your feetIn the kitchen, one more chair than you need, ohAnd you're angry, and you should be, it's not fairJust 'cause you can't see it doesn't mean it isn't thereIf they sayWho cares if one more light goes out?In the sky of a million starsIt flickers, flickersWho cares when someone's time runs out?If a moment is all we areOr quicker, quickerWho cares if one more light goes out?Well, I do(I do)Who cares if one more light goes out?In the sky of a million starsIt flickers, flickersWho cares when someone's time runs out?If a moment is all we areOr quicker, quickerWho cares if one more light goes out?Well, I doWell, I do"
