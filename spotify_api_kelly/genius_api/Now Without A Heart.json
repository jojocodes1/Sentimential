  "lyrics": "I'm now without a heartBreaking downBleeding outI'm now without a heartBleeding outOh oh ohCause you told meWe never be apartWe saw among the starsHad the plan in heartAnd now you tell meThat this was from the startWas never meant too farHad the change in heartCause I'm never gonna feel any loveCause I've never ever been here beforeBut I hate feeling aloneTelling myself that I'm fine being aloneYou left me and my heart is a stoneThis house is not a home"
