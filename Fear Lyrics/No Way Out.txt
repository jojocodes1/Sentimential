No way out!
Looking out, standing over the edge
Too numb to feel alive
So why the fuck are these thoughts in my head?
Reach in and pull them out
Still nothing feels the same
Too late to hesitate
Why can't I run and escape from myself
And live again?
Why can't I run and escape from myself?
Tell me why I feel like there's no way out
Trying hard to heal as the pain pours out
I don't wanna feel this way
But it's hard 'cause I know that in the end
There's no way out
Oh my God, is this really the end?
I guess I'm not alright
I just can't tell what is real anymore
I'm trapped in my own hell
I know this can't be real
This negativity
Is dominating and smothering me
I just can't breathe
I just can't tell what is real anymore
Tell me why I feel like there's no way out
Trying hard to heal as the pain pours out
I don't wanna feel this way
But it's hard 'cause I know that in the end
There's no way out
There's nothing left for me
Just tainted memories
There's no one here for me
Just let me be
Why can't I run and escape from myself?
I just can't tell what is real anymore
Tell me why I feel like there's no way out
Trying hard to heal as the pain pours out
I don't wanna feel this way
But it's hard 'cause I know that in the end
There's no, no way out!
Yeah
Oh my God, is this really the end?
