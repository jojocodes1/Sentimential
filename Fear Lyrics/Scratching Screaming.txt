I used to look in the mirror
Back when everything was clear
Nothing real to fear
But now all I taste are tears
I never thought my life would come to this
Recklessness
I never thought I would amount to this
Ignorance
I hear the voices calling me
They own my life they're the ones who taunt me
Scratching, screaming, feeding my pain
Running through the darkness I'm just trying to be free
Be free
Be free
I just wanna be free
Searching for an exit but there's nothing to be seen
Why me
Why me
I just wanna be free
Save me from my hell
One step forward, but a thousand steps back
Standing on the edge, and I think I'm going to crack
One step forward, but a thousand steps back
Standing on the edge, and I think I'm going to crack
One step forward, but a thousand steps back
Standing on the edge, and I think I'm going to crack
One step forward, but a thousand steps back
Standing on the edge, and I think I'm going to crack
One step forward, but a thousand steps back
Standing on the edge, and I think I'm going to crack
One step forward, but a thousand steps back
Standing on the edge, and I think I'm going to crack
I feel it boiling in my blood
I use to hold it back
I never thought it would take me
Scratching screaming feeding my pain
Running through the darkness I'm just trying to be free
Be free
Be free
I just wanna be free
Searching for an exit but there's nothing to be seen
Why me
Why me
I just wanna be free
Save me from my hell
One step forward, but a thousand steps back
Standing on the edge, and I think I'm going to crack
One step forward, but a thousand steps back
Standing on the edge, and I think I'm going to crack
