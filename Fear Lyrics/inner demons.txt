They say, "Don't let them in
Close your eyes and clear your thoughts again."
But when I'm all alone
They show up on their own
'Cause inner demons fight their battles with fire
Inner demons don't play by the rules
They say, "Just push them down, just fight them harder
Why would give up on it so soon?"
So angels, angels, please, just keep on fighting
Angels don't give up on me today
'Cause the demons, they are there
They just keep biting
'Cause inner demons just won't go away
So angels, please, hear my prayer
Life is pain, life's not fair
So angels, please, please stay here
Take the pain, take the fear
They say, "It won't be hard"
But they can't see the battles in my heart
But when I turn away
The demons seem to stay
'Cause inner demons don't play well with angels
They cheat, and lie, and steal, and break, and bruise
Angels please, protect me from these rebels
This is a battle I don't want to lose
So angels, angels, please, just keep on fighting
Angels don't give up on me today
'Cause the demons, they are there
They just keep biting
'Cause inner demons just won't go away
So angels, angels, please, just keep on fighting (keep on fighting)
Angels don't give up on me today
'Cause the demons, they are there
They just keep biting
'Cause inner demons just won't go away
So angels, please, hear my prayer
Life is pain, life's not fair
So angels, please, please stay here
Take the pain, take the fear
