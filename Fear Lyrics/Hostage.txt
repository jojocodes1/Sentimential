I see my demons staring at me now
Trapped in the hand of all that pulls me down
It's pulling me down, it's bleeding me out
I fight and fight behind these eyes to find a sign of life
Hostage!
Am I the only one?
Hostage!
Am I the only one?
I see my demons staring at me now
Invading all of my dreams and I can't get 'em out
No I can't get 'em out
Can't make a fucking sound
I fight and fight behind these eyes to find a sign of life
Hostage!
Am I the only one?
Hostage!
Am I the only one?
Will it ever let me go?!
Will it ever let me go?!
Will it ever let me go?!
(I see my demons staring at me now!)
(I see my demons staring at me now!)
I think I'm gonna die here...
I think I'm gonna die here...
I think I'm gonna die here!
(I think I'm gonna die here...)
I think I'm gonna die here!
(I think I'm gonna die!)
I think I'm gonna die here!
