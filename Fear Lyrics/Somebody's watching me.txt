Who's watching?
Tell me who's watching?
Who's watching me?
I'm just an average man with an average life
I work from 9 to 5, hey hell, I pay the price
All I want is to be left alone, in my average home
But why do I always feel
Like I'm in the Twilight Zone?
I always feel like somebody's watchin' me
And I have no privacy (oh oh oh)
I always feel like somebody's watchin' me
Tell me is it just a dream?
When I come home at night
I bang the door real tight
People call me on the phone I'm trying to avoid
Or can the people on TV see me or am I just paranoid?
When I'm in the shower, I'm afraid to wash my hair
'Cause I might open my eyes and find someone standing there!
People say I'm crazy, just a little touched
But maybe showers remind me of Psycho too much
That's why
I always feel like somebody's watchin' me
And I have no privacy (oh oh oh)
I always feel like somebody's watchin' me
Who's playing tricks on me?
(Who's watching me?)
I don't know anymore!
Are the neighbours watching me? (Who's watching?)
Well is the mailman watching me? (Tell me who's watching?)
And I don't feel safe anymore, oh what a mess
I wonder who's watching me now! (Who?)
The IRS?!
I always feel like somebody's watchin' me
And I have no privacy (oh oh oh)
I always feel like somebody's watchin' me
Tell me is it just a dream
I always feel like somebody's watchin' me
And I have no privacy (oh oh oh oh)
I always feel like somebody's watchin' me
Who's playing tricks on me?
(Oh oh oh)
(Who's watching me?)
I always feel like somebody's watchin' me
Ooh, num, ah, ooh
I always feel like somebody's watchin' me
(Who's watching me?)
I always feel like somebody's watching me
Ooh, num, ah, ooh
I always feel like somebody's watching me
(Who's watching me?)
I always feel like somebody's watching me
And I have no privacy (oh oh oh oh)
I always feel like somebody's watching me
I can't enjoy my tea! (Who's watching me?)
I always feel like somebody's watching me
Can I have my privacy? (Oh oh oh)
I always feel like somebody's watching me
Who's watching me? (Who's watching me?)
I always feel like somebody's watching me
Hee hee (oh oh oh oh)
I always feel like somebody's watching me
Stop playing tricks on me! (Who's watching me?)
I always feel like somebody's watching me
Why don't they leave me be? (Oh oh oh)
I always feel like somebody's watching me
