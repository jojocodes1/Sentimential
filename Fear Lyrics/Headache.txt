Some days I'm narcissistic
Some days I'm in my way
Some days I try to speak with pins and needles in my brain
Some days I feel sadistic, a portrait of my pain
Some days I live in fear that I am every fucking thing I hate
Shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up
Shut up, shut up, shut up
Shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up
Shut up, shut up, shut up
Follow me down, under the skin, I am doubt
Feeding the flies in your mouth through my eyes
I know that I'm gonna be fine
Some days I feel addictive
Some days I feel alone
Some days I fear the worst in me is the best you'll ever know
Some days I feel the static with every word I know
Some days I feel like I just want to, want to slit a motherfucker's throat
Shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up
Shut up, shut up, shut up
Shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up
Shut up, shut up, shut up
Follow me down, under the skin, I am doubt
Feeding the flies in my mouth through my eyes
I know that I'm gonna be fine
Swallow the pain, selling my sorrow for shame
Sanity circles the train with a smile
I know that I'm gonna be fine
I know that I'm gonna be fine
I know that I'm gonna be fine
I know that I'm gonna be fine
Oh God, am I gonna be fine?
Bright lights, am I dead or alive?
So insane I'm losing my mind
I made a deal with the devil inside
Oh God, I'm gonna be fine
(Go) Shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up
(Go) Shut up, shut up, shut up
(Go) Shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up
(Go) Shut up, shut up, shut up
Decay and follow me down, under the skin, I am doubt
Feeding the flies in my mouth through my eyes
I know that I'm gonna be fine
I swallow the pain, selling my sorrow for shame
Sanity circles the train with a smile
I swear that I'm gonna be fine
