Paralyzed from the neck down
Can't move, can't scream, can't make a sound
The shadows move and enclose the room
Creating the familiar silhouettes that
Stalk and linger throughout the nights
Wake up
Teasing, they aim to mangle your perception of reality
Staring back at you, making sure you see and feel their presence
Numb from fear
They reach over and hover above
To remind you what you've always been told
You'll never get rid of them and your life is a lost soul
Wake up
I'll never sleep again
I'll never be the same
I'm crawling out of my own skin
I'm drowning in pain
They watch, they wait, they accumulate incontestably through the dying light
To fulfill my miserable construct
My every night
I am imprisoned to the shadows of a different realm
Realize that this is hell
I am imprisoned to the shadows of a different realm
Realize that this is hell
I am imprisoned to the shadows of a different realm
This is the darkest form of mental torture, this is hell
My body is numb, only my eyes can move
And witness the hateful energy
That stares back into the depths of me
Paralyzed, paranormal paralysis
Preying on perception
And wretchedness
I am the hopeless
I'm one with the night
Take me
I'll never sleep again
I'll never be the same
I'm crawling out of my own skin
I'm drowning in pain
They watch, they wait, they accumulate incontestably through the dying light
To fulfill my miserable construct
My every night
I am imprisoned to the shadows of a different realm
Realize that this is hell
I am imprisoned to the shadows of a different realm
This is the darkest form of mental torture, this is hell
My body is numb, only my eyes can move
And witness the hateful energy
That stares back into the depths of me
Paralyzed, paranormal paralysis
Preying on fucking perception
And wretchedness
Wake up
Wake up
Wake up
Wake up
Realize that this is hell
