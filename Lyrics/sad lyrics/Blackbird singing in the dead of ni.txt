Blackbird singing in the dead of night
Take these broken wings and learn to fly
All your life
You were only waiting for this moment to arise
(You were only waiting for this moment to arise)
Blackbird singing in the dead of night (dead of night, night)
Take these sunken eyes and learn to see (learn to see all your life)
All your life (all your life)
You were only waiting for this moment to be free
Blackbird fly (blackbird, blackbird, fly, fly, fly, fly)
Blackbird fly (blackbird, blackbird, fly, fly, fly, fly)
Into the light of a dark, black night
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Blackbird fly (fly, fly)
Blackbird fly (fly)
Into the light of a dark, black night
Blackbird singing in the dead of night
Take these broken wings and learn to fly (learn to fly, learn to fly)
All your life
You were only waiting for this moment to arise
You were only waiting for this moment to arise
You were only waiting for this moment to arise
