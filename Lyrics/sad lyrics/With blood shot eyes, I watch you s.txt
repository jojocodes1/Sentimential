With blood shot eyes, I watch you sleeping
The warmth I feel beside me is slowly fading
Would she hear me, if I called her name?
Would she hold me, if she knew my shame?
There's always something different going on
The path I walk's in the wrong direction
There's always someone fucking hanging on
Can anybody help me make things better?
your tears don't fall, they crash around me
Her conscious calls, the guilty to come home
Your tears don't fall, they crash around me
Her conscious calls, the guilty to come home
The moments died, I hear no screaming
The visions left inside me are slowly fading
Would she hear me, if I called her name?
Would she hold me, if she knew my shame?
There's always something different going on
The path I walk's in the wrong direction
There's always someone fucking hanging on
Can anybody help me make things better?
your tears don't fall, they crash around me
Her conscious calls, the guilty to come home
Your tears don't fall, they crash around me
Her conscious calls, the guilty to come home
Oh, yeah
This battered room I've seen before
The broken bones they heal no more, no more
With my last breath I'm choking
Will this ever end? I'm hoping
My world is over one more time
Let's go
Would she hear me, if I called her name?
Would she hold me, if she knew my shame?
There's always something different going on
The path I walk's in the wrong direction
There's always someone fucking hanging on
Can anybody help me make things better?
your tears don't fall, they crash around me
Her conscious calls, the guilty to come home
(tears don't fall) Your tears don't fall, they crash around me
(conscience calls) her conscious calls, the guilty to come
Better
Your tears don't fall, they crash around me
Her conscious calls, the guilty to come home (conscience calls)
