What I want, you've got
And it might be hard to handle
But like the flame that burns the candle
The candle feeds the flame, yeah, yeah
What I've got's full stock
Of thoughts and dreams that scatter
Then you pull them all together
And how, I can't explain
Oh yeah
Well, well you (ohh-ohh, ohh-ohh-ohh)
You make my dreams come true
(You-ooh, you-you-ohh-ohh, you-ooh)
Well, well, well, you (ohh-ohh, ohh-ohh-ohh)
Oh yeah
You make my dreams come true
(You-ooh, you-you-ohh-ohh) well, yeah (you-ooh)
On a night when bad dreams become a screamer
When they're messin' with a dreamer
I can laugh it in the face
Twist and shout my way out
And wrap yourself around me
'Cause I ain't the way you found me
And I'll never be the same, oh yeah
Well, 'cause you (ohh-ohh, ohh-ohh-ohh)
You make my dreams come true
(You-ooh, you-you-ohh-ohh) Oh yeah (you-ooh)
Well, well, well, you (ohh-ohh, ohh-ohh-ohh)
You make my dreams come true
(You-ooh, you-you-ohh-ohh) oh yeah (you-ooh)
Well listen to this, oh
I'm down on the daydream
Oh, that sleepwalk should be over by now, I know
Well you, yeah, yeah
You make my dreams come true
(You-ooh, you-you-ohh-ohh) oh yeah (you-ooh)
I've been waiting for, waiting for you girl (ohh-ohh, ohh-ohh-ohh)
Oh yeah
You make my dreams come true
(Make, you make, you make)
I've been waiting for, waiting for you girl
(Ohh-ohh, ohh-ohh-ohh) all night
You make my dreams come true
(You-ooh, you-you-ohh-ohh, you-ooh) oh, whoa, whoa
I've been waiting for, waiting for, waiting for, waiting for
Waiting for, waiting for, waiting for
(You make my dreams-)
(You-ooh, you-you-ohh-ohh)
I've been waiting for you girl
(You make my dreams-)
