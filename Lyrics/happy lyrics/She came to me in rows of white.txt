She came to me in rows of white
In the corner of my room
A specter of the night
Silhouetted by the moon
We're floating fast over traffic lights
Bearing down on blackened skies
And colors burst as I close my eyes
Ooh, and she said
Lay me down in golden dandelions
'Cause I've been waitin' for this moment all my life
Follow me into the dark, ooh
She said, lay me down in golden dandelions
'Cause I've been waitin'
A thousand pictures in my mind
In a painting of the past
I'm brushing over lines
And I'll paint them all again
We're floating fast over traffic lights
Bearing down on blackened skies
And colors burst as I close my eyes
Ooh, and she said
Lay me down in golden dandelions
'Cause I've been waitin' for this moment all my life
Follow me into the dark, ooh
And she said, lay me down in golden dandelions
'Cause I've been waitin'
'Cause I've been waitin'
And aren't we bright in the candlelight
And I will cradle all these memories 'til the end
And she said
Lay me down in golden dandelions
'Cause I've been waiting for this moment all my life
Follow me into the dark, ooh
And she said, lay me down in golden dandelions
'Cause I've been waitin'
Yeah, I've been waitin'
'Cause I've been waitin'
