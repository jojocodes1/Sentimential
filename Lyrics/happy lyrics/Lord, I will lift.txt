Lord, I will lift
Mine eyes to the hills
Knowing my help
Is coming from You
Your peace you give me
In time of the storm
You are the source of my strength
You are the strength of my life
I lift my hands in total praise to You
You are the source of my strength
You are the strength of my life
I lift my hands in total praise to You
Amen, amen (amen)
Amen, amen (amen)
Amen, amen (amen)
Amen, amen (amen)
You are the source of my strength
You are the strength of my life
I lift my hands in total praise to You
Amen, amen (amen)
Amen, amen (amen)
Amen, amen (amen)
Amen, amen (amen)
Woah, Hallelujah
