Dreams of torture bring pleasure, inflicting pain is my need
Breathing the sickest desires, to hurt the living, make them bleed
Visions of anguish and torment, control my every thought
Can't tear the eyes out of my own mind, I cannot make it stop
Strip the flesh, burn the flesh, exceed the limits of pain
Lust for torture taking over, complete submission to the insane
Submit to the suffering, I am taking your life
Cut you deep now you bleed for me, completely reduced, dehumanized
Crawling on stumps you beg for mercy, set you free from this hell
Alive and burning you twist in pain, flesh is melting, you pray for the kill
Inflicting pain, indeed is pleasure, to a mind unclean
To realize, the way of torture, to bring to life my dream
Dine on the screams of torment, drink from the tears of pain
Feast on the desecration, the horrifying screams
Submit to the suffering
