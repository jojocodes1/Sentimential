I've should've known better
Than to give that girl a chance
I wish I never met her
'Cause now she's with another man
Maybe he can dance better than I can
Maybe he's got them softer bitch boy hands
Maybe he can keep you out this town
And maybe stay on your side of that county line
'Cause you've got your friends, darlin' I've got mine
I heard you're in town, been riding around
With somebody new and prolly burning it down
You don't wanna be seen rolling in my bar
'Cause everybody here knows how you broke my heart
Stay out of dodge, stay out of my life, stay out of this town
And stay on your side of that county line
I thought we'd be forever
But you couldn't make up your mind
And maybe you'll remember when you kiss him
You used to sleep here every night
Maybe he's making more money than I can
Maybe he's got more followers on instagram
Maybe he can get you off my mind
And maybe stay on your side of that county line
'Cause you've got your friends, darlin I've got mine
I heard you're in town, been riding around
With somebody new, you're probably burning it down
You don't wanna be seen rolling in my bar
'Cause everybody here knows how you broke my heart
Stay out of dodge, stay out of my life, stay out of this town
And Stay on your side of that county line
You prolly think it's funny
What you're doing to me
I'm really dying inside
Look what you're doing to me
You prolly think it's funny
What you're doing to me
I'm really dying inside
Look what you're doing to me
Side of that county line
You've got your friends, darlin I got mine
I heard you're in town, riding around
With somebody new, you're probably burning it down
You don't wanna be seen rolling in my bar
'Cause everybody here knows how you broke my heart
Stay out of dodge, stay out of my life, stay out of this town
And stay on your side of that county line
You prolly think it's funny
What you're doing to me
I'm really dying inside
(Look what you're doing to me) and stay on your side of that county line
You prolly think it's funny
What you're doing to me
I'm really dying inside
Look what you're doing to me
You prolly think it's funny
What you're doing to me
I'm really dying inside
Look what you're doing to me
