Ring the alarm
I been through this too long
But I'll be damned if I see another chick on your arm
Won't you ring the alarm?
I been through this too long
But I'll be damned if I see another chick on your arm
She gon' be rockin' chinchilla coats
If I let you go (no)
Getting the house off the coast
If I let you go (no)
She gon' take everything I own
If I let you go (no)
I can't let you go (oh)
Damn, if I let you go (no)
She gon' rock them VVS stones
If I let you go (no)
— in the 'bach or the Rolls
If I let you go (no)
She gon' profit everythin' I taught
If I let you go (no)
I can't let you go (oh)
Damn, if I let you go (no)
Tell me how should I feel when I know what I know
And my female intuition telling me you're a dog?
People told me 'bout the flames, I couldn't see through the smoke
When I need answers, accusations
What you mean, you gone choke?
You can't stay, you gotta go (no)
Ain't no other chicks spending your dough
This is taking a toll, the way the story unfolds
Not the picture-perfect movie everyone would've sawed
She gon' be rockin' chinchilla coats
If I let you go (no)
Getting in the house off the coast
If I let you go (no)
She gon' take everything I own
If I let you go (no)
I can't let you go (oh)
Damn, if I let you go (no)
She gon' rock them VVS stones
If I let you go (no)
— in the 'bach or the Rolls
If I let you go (no)
She gon' profit everything I taught
If I let you go (no)
I can't let you go (oh)
Damn, if I let you go (no)
Ring the alarm
I been through this too long
But I'll be damned if I see another chick on your arm
Won't you ring the alarm?
I been through this too long
But I'll be damned if I see another chick on your arm
Tell me how should I feel, when you made me belong?
And the thought of you just touching her is what I hate most
I don't want you, but I want it and I can't let it go
To know you give it to her like you gave it to me, come on
He's so arrogant and bold (oh)
She gon' love that shit, I know
I done put in a call, time to ring the alarm
'Cause you ain't never seen a fire like the one I'ma cause
She gon' be rockin' chinchilla coats
If I let you go (no)
Getting in the house off the coast
If I let you go (no)
She gon' take everything I own
If I let you go (no)
I can't let you go (oh)
Damn, if I let you go (no)
She gon' rock them VVS stones
If I let you go (no)
— in the 'bach or the Rolls
If I let you go (no)
She gon' profit everything I taught
If I let you go (no)
I can't let you go (oh)
Damn, if I let you go (no)
how can you look at me
And not see all the things that I kept only just for you?
Why would you risk it, baby, is that the price that I pay?
But this is my show and I won't let you go
All has been paid for, and it's mine
How could you look at me, and not see all the things?
She gon' be rockin' chinchilla coats
If I let you go (no)
Getting in the house off the coast
If I let you go (no)
She gon' take everything I own
If I let you go (no)
I can't let you go (oh)
Damn, if I let you go (no)
She gon' rock them VVS stones
If I let you go (no)
— in the 'bach or the Rolls
If I let you go (no)
She gon' profit everything I taught
If I let you go (no)
I can't let you go (oh)
Damn, if I let you go (no)
