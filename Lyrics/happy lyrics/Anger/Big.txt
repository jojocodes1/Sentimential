Khaliel juneOnnaBeat, JuneOnnaBeat
Smokin' cigars fatter than a Swisher sweet
Caught him on a corner
Nigga thought he had me beat
I’m on location
I'ma die right in the streets
Shooters trailin' on my rear wit’
A Glock on a seat
He want it wit me, shit what's up
Nigga smoke somethin'
Talkin' like he 'bout it
You ain't never Baby Joe'd somethin'
I talk that talk, I walk that walk
You know I tote somethin’
Bitch, I’m out the 8
I said it straight I'm tryna blow somethin’
Put my flex down, I'ma spray that TEC round
Ben put the bet down
I'ma spin then spin again and wet
Their block until the sundown
In FruitTown not far from sundown
We ain't make not one sound
Keep passin’ by they trap and they ain't
Out that bitch get burnt down'
Menace to society and I won't stop for nobody
So what you mean you know we 'bout it
I get work with the shotty
He ran his bike in KK car
I up that bitch and I shot him
Never be silent, we be wylin'
Where I'm from they get violent
I got that money, turnt to poppin'
Collected over two bodies
And I invested in the smoke so if
You want it we got it
Plus I've been bootin' up off of that molly
Bitch I'm turnt out my body
I don't give a fuck 'bout what you say
Bitch you ain't stepped on nobody
RIP boo bitch, he'd been spinnin' on shit
Before they caught him
We never beef, put shit to sleep
I take that name as a daughter
I started steppin' on my own
I turned myself to a rider
Tryin' to knock you niggas out
Bitch I done lost every dollar
I run it up and get it
Back, I'm tryna slatt shit
I'll wipe his nose
Bitch I buy that food from Birdman
B ain't never closed
Bitch I'm out the North and every
Nigga wit' me throw them fours
Bitch I got a problem, ask my momma
I be whoopin' hoes now eat that dick up
Better make it spit up before I beat it up
Don't wanna let Montana fuck
Take our clothes and make her get the fuck
She say that I'm a dirty bitch and I'm
Wrong but I don't give a fuck
When you tryna be a part this business
You can hit me up retarded
They ain't gotta say my name, I'm a starter
He movin' wrong, they say he tellin' so I
Cannot fuck with no body crash the party
Walk up in that bitch to get me started
My comprehension is distorted
Ask me can I spell like hardly
He talk 'bout takin' mine
You must ain't heard I slang that iron
Don't do no blinkin' or no duckin'
When this bitch'll go to firin'
All behind my cousin and the
Bottom shot eleven times
The clip wasn't full, when I counted it
Only came out to nine oh you fuck with nine
When niggas say when you ready
Spin on your block with them cutters and
We gon' see who be steppin'
He say he down to ride
We'll send that bitch up to heaven
Stay with them shots, I keep that Glock
I fell in love when I met it
He want it with me, nigga, smoke somethin'
You feel a nigga playin', when you
Drop your nuts, pussy bitch
You gotta show somethin'
This nigga must think I'm a hoe or somethin'
I gotta do this nigga dirty
Spin the beam and smash 'em all
Up on the porch or somethin'
(Ok, I'm a 38 baby for real)
Straight out the North livin' lavish
My youngin' never had a daddy
He'll let a bitch have it
I hide my pack inside the house
Put my stick under the mattress
And bust a nigga dome in seconds
Now that's what I call magic
(That slime shit)
