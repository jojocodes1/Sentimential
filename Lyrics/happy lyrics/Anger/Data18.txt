We don't need another pretty boy singin' pretty songs
Fake country boys, doin' country all wrong
We need another Haggard, or a Johnny Cash
Somebody chewin' 'baccer, and whippin' ass
I need a preacher, I need a savior, how about y'all?
Can I get an outlaw?

Let me get a outlaw like the man who raised me up
Haulin' chickens to Kentucky in the back of beat up trucks
Because all I'm seein' now is Hollywood wearin' some huntin' gear
And T.V. shows 'bout idiots that think country is drinkin' beer
I'm sick of seein' skinny jeans smilin' like a cover girl
I wanna see some kids outback with .22's poppin' squirrels
I wanna see some young guns goin' out on a duck hunt
And lesser of this Flappy Bird and actin' like a lazy bum
'Cause trends got it twisted and they make country a petty style
Now where's all my country folks that actually could go survive?
When that stock market crashes I'll be somewhere deep off in these pines
Killin' shit, kickin' ass, and takin' what the hell is mine

We don't need another pretty boy singin' pretty songs
Fake country boys, doin' country all wrong
We need another Haggard, or a Johnny Cash
Somebody chewin' 'baccer and whipping ass
I need a preacher, I need a savior, how about y'all?
Can I get an outlaw?

I got scars on my knuckles from a loud mouth in the parkin' lot
Knife wounds in my back from so called friends that tend to lie a lot
There's snakes up in the grass but bubba, shit, I'm used to walkin' tall
And if I feel you're talkin' shit, won't second guess to jack your jaw
Today the world we live in, realness tends to wash and fade away
That's why if you ain't walkin' shit then I don't care for shit you say
I met the folks I idolize and so far they're some white ass lies
Just country fake in good disguise, now tell me how that tends to fly?
I'm on my southern pride twang, baby, come and roll with me
Backwoods as it gets and not the shit that you see on TV
I'm talking Chevy C10, kickin' up some brown rocks
.30-06 with a cedar-stained wood stock

We don't need another pretty boy singin' pretty songs
Fake country boys, doin' country all wrong
We need another Haggard, or a Johnny Cash
Somebody chewin' 'baccer, and whipping ass
I need a preacher, I need a savior, how about y'all?
Can I get an outlaw?

I stay comin' in like a rock so they be callin' me the Scottsdale
Cornbread fed and you know I'm raisin' plenty hell
I'm turnt up like some honkies at a kegger party in a hotel
And I'm breakin' down these barriers like drywall that needs repair
I'm cold with my shit, boy, I'm cold with my style boy
That backwoods, that hick town, that late night, that drivin' round
That George Strait cranked real loud, got lightnin' bugs on my windshield
That back road, no cops found and I'm sippin' on that hot brown
I RHEC shit, my motto, got rednecks by the truckload
That smell good, stay sprayed on, I hit downtown and take girls home
That bonfire, light that up, home grown shit, roll one
I got a gun rack in my back glass and a big gun, it holds one

We don't need another pretty boy singin' pretty songs
Fake country boys, doin' country all wrong
We need another Haggard, or a Johnny Cash
Somebody chewin' 'baccer, and whipping ass
I need a preacher, I need a savior, how about y'all?
Can I get an outlaw?
