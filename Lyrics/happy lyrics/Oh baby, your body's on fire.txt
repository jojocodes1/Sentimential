This one na gbedu wey dey ja pata
Me, I no get time, I dey da pada
Dada cover my face, calling me Lagbaja
Biggie man, wey no dey wear agbada
Tell me, tell me
My nigga, what's it gon' be?
G-Wagon, or the Bentley?
The girl dem riding with me
I no fit die for nothing
My nigga, what's it gon' be?
G-Wagon, or the Bentley?
The girl dem riding with me
I no fit die for nothing
Make you know say anything wey you do, dem must commentate
(I can't come and kill myself)
So anything wey I dey do, I dey try to dey do am my way
(I can't come and kill myself)
Plenty, plenty, plenty suffer wey we face
Just to make sure money dey
But my people dem go say
I no wan kpai, I no wan die
I no wan kpeme, I wan enjoy
I wan chop life, I wan buy motor
I wan build house, I still wan turn up
Tell me, tell me
My nigga, what's it gon' be?
G-Wagon, or the Bentley?
The girl dem riding with me
I no fit, die for nothing
My nigga, what's it gon' be?
G-Wagon, or the Bentley?
The girl dem riding with me
I no fit
Different things dem happening
Schemes and packaging
Inna one night, four shows I'm juggling
Flow like the ocean, my boat I'm paddling
Shout out Shina Peller, that's my bro, my family
Frozen chains
When it comes to money, I dey concentrate
Make I tell you straight, you are not my mate
If you be commissioner, I be head of state
But my people dem go say
I no wan kpai, I no wan die
I no wan kpeme, I wan enjoy
I wan chop life, I wan buy motor
I wan build house, I still wan turn up
Tell me, tell me
My nigga, what's it gon' be?
G-Wagon, or the Bentley?
The girl dem riding with me
I no fit, die for nothing
My nigga, what's it gon' be?
G-Wagon, or the Bentley?
The girl dem riding with me
I no fit, die for nothing
