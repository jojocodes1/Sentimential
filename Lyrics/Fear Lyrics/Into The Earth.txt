Sensation leaves as I'm drifting slowly
Illusions torn from my splintered veins
Reality shifts like pages turning in the wind
I'll become the sun, I'll become a god, I'll become the dreamer
Dreaming, frozen, in my anxious mind
Feeling slowly fades into plasticity
Is this the end, or just the beginning?
Lucidity or nightmare unfolding?
My heart, my soul
My body has grown so cold
Converge, I crash
Into the Earth
Into the Earth
Into the Earth
Lost in the scape, terrified
Break me free from this nightmare
Stifled by realms uncertain
I can't escape
Let me, let me go, I'm fucking horrified
Now all my fears are personified
Numbed to the call of a broken idol
Descent of the mind, losing touch
Sensation leaves as I'm drifting slowly
Illusions torn from my splintered veins
Reality shifts like pages turning in the wind
I'll become the sun, I'll become a god, I'll become the dreamer
Feeling slowly fades into plasticity
Is this the end or just the beginning?
Lucidity or nightmare unfolding?
My heart, my soul
My body has grown so cold
Converge, I crash
Into the Earth
Into the Earth
Into the Earth
My heart, my soul
My body has grown so cold
Converge, I crash
Into the Earth
Into the Earth
Into the Earth
Hallucinations of familiar sensations envelop me in inebriation
The continuation of a world with no reins bound for destruction
Within this fevered dream, I'll have forgotten
Releasing me
Vivify this world falls in my descent
Realizing this world is but a projection of my mind!
