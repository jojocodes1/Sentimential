Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Every time you cross my mind, you get right under my skin
Am I crazy, out my mind, this situation I'm in
And it gets harder just to breathe, feel like the walls are closin' in
But all I need is some closure
Yeah, I can't eat, I can't sleep, I get anxiety
When you're not here with me, I get anxiety
I can't eat, I can't sleep, don't know why you can't see
You give me, you give me, give me
Anxiet-xiet, xiet, xiet-xiet-xiet, xiet-xiety-ty
Xiet, xiet-xiet-xiet
Give me anxiety
Xiet-xiet, xiet, xiet-xiety-ty
Xiet, xiet-xiet-xiet
Anxiety
Every time I smile while I'm doin' fine, does it show?
'Cause I'm really freaking out, too scared of letting you go
Then my heart drowns out my thoughts, my head's about to explode
What I need is some closure
I, I can't eat, I can't sleep, I get anxiety
When you're not here with me, I get anxiety
I can't eat, I can't sleep, don't know why you can't see
You give me, you give me, give me
Anxiet-xiet, xiet, xiet-xiet-xiet, xiet-xiety-ty
Xiet, xiet-xiet-xiet
Give me anxiety
Xiet-xiet, xiet, xiet-xiety-ty
Xiet, xiet-xiet-xiet
Anxiety (anxiety)
(If you ain't beside me)
Every time I smile while I'm doin' fine, does it show?
'Cause' I'm really freaking out, too scared of letting you go
I can't eat, I can't sleep, I get anxiety
When you're not here with me, I get anxiety
I can't eat, I can't sleep, don't know why you can't see
You give me, you give me, give me anxiety
Anxiety
Give me anxiety
Anxiety
