I sit alone in my four cornered room
Staring at candles
Yo that shit is on?
Let me drop some shit like this here
At night I can't sleep
I toss an turn
Candlesticks in the dark
Visions of bodies burned
Four walls just staring at a nigga
I'm paranoid sleepin with my finger on the trigger
My mothers always stressin I ain't livin right
But I ain't goin out without a fight
See Everytime my eyes close
I start sweating
An blood starts comin out my nose
Is somebody watchin me act
But I don't know who it is
So I'm watchin my back
I can see em when I'm deep in the covers
When I awake I don't see the motherfucker
He owns a black hat like I own
A black suit and a cane like my own
Some might say take a chill B
But fuck that shit there's a nigga tryna kill me
I'm poppin in the clip when the wind blows
Every 20 seconds got me peepin out my window
Investigating the joint for traps
Checkin my telephone for taps
I'm staring at the woman on the corner
It's fucked up when ya mind is playin tricks on ya
I make big money, I drive big cars
Everybody know me
It's like I'm a movie star
But late at night, something ain't right
I feel I'm being tailed by the same suckers headlights
Is it that fool that I ran off the block
Or is it that nigga last week that I shot
Or is it the one I beat for five thousand dollars
Thought he had Caine but it was Gold
Made of flour
Reached under my seat, grabbed a pumper for the suckers
Ain't no used to me lying, I was scared er than a motherfucker
Whipped a left in the Popeyes
An barreled out quick if it's goin down let's get this shit over wit
Here they come, just like I figured
I got my hand on the motherfuckin trigger
What I saw make ya ass start giggling
Three blind, crippled and crazy senior citizens
I live by the sword
I take my boys everywhere I go
Because I'm paranoid
I keep looking over my shoulder
Peeping around corners
My mind is playin tricks on me
Day by day it's more impossible to cope
I feel like I'm the one that's doing dope
Can't keep a steady hand because I'm nervous
Every Sunday morning I'm in service
Prayin for forgiveness
An tryna find an exit out the business
I know the Lord is lookin at me
But yet it's still hard for me to feel happy
I often drift when I drive
Having fatal thoughts of suicide
Bang! And get it over with
An then I'm worry free!
But that's bullshit
I got a little boy to look after
And if I die then my child will be a bastard
I had a woman down wit me
But to me it seemed like she was down to get me
She helped me out in this shit
But to me she was just another bitch
Now she's back with her mother
Now I'm realizing that I love her
Now I'm feeling lonely
My mind is playin tricks on me
This year Halloween fell on the weekend
Me an Geto boys are trick-r-treatin'
Robbin little kids for bags
Till an old man got behind our ass
So we speeded up the pace
Took a look back
An he was right before our face
He'd be in for a squabble no doubt
So I swung an hit the nigga in his mouth
He was goin down we figured
But this wasn't no ordinary nigga
He stood about six or seven feet
Now that's the nigga I be seein in my sleep
So we triple teamed on em
Droppin them motherfuckin B's on em
The more I swung, the more blood flew
Then he disappeared
And my boys disappeared too
Then I felt just like a fiend
It wasn't even close to Halloween
It was dark as fuck on the streets
My hands were all bloody
From punchin on the concrete
Goddamn homie
My mind is playing tricks on me
