Some days, things just take
Way too much of my energy
I look up and the whole room's spinning
You take my cares away
I can so over-complicate, people tell me to medicate
Feel my blood running, swear the sky's falling
I know that all this -'s fabricated
Time goes by and I, can't control my mind
Don't know what else to try, but you tell me every time
Just keep breathin', and breathin', and breathin', and breathin'
And oh, I gotta keep, keep on breathin'
Just keep breathin', and breathin', and breathin', and breathin'
And oh, I gotta keep, keep on breathin', mmm-mmm
Sometimes, it's hard to find
Find my way up into the clouds
Tune it out, they can be so loud
You remind me of a time
When things weren't so complicated
All I need is to see your face
Feel my blood running, swear the sky's falling
I know that all this -'s fabricated
Time goes by and I, can't control my mind
Don't know what else to try, but you tell me every time
Just keep breathin', and breathin', and breathin', and breathin'
And oh, I gotta keep, I keep on breathin'
Just keep breathin', and breathin', and breathin', and breathin'
And oh, I gotta keep, I keep on breathin', mmm-mmm, yeah
My, my air, my, my air
My, my air, my air
My, my air, my, my air
My, my air, yeah
Just keep breathin', and breathin', and breathin', and breathin'
And I, and oh, I gotta keep, I keep on breathin'
Just keep breathin', and breathin', and breathin', and breathin'
And oh, I gotta keep, I keep on breathin', mmm-mmm, yeah
Feel my blood running, swear the sky's falling (oh, whoa)
I keep on breathin' (oh, yeah)
Time goes by and I, can't control my mind
I keep on breathin', mmm-mmm, yeah
