Nowadays, I lie awake
Spend my nights talking to my ceiling
Keep to myself
I've always felt outnumbered
Spin my head around
I keep wondering who's out to get me
Cut my ties
Live my life in circles
Nowadays, I look over my shoulder
Paranoia eating at my mind
I don't know if I can take it much longer
Fighting and no one's on my side
To say how I've lost my way out
Nowadays I look over my shoulder
Fighting, but no one's on my side (no one's on my side)
It's safe to say I can't relate
Learned to hide in crowded places
Turn off my phone
Never know where to find me
There's a price to pay
I can never seem to learn my lesson
Spend my time even though I can't afford it
Nowadays, I look over my shoulder
Paranoia eating at my mind
I don't know if I can take it much longer
Fighting and no one's on my side
To say how I've lost my way out
Nowadays I look over my shoulder
Fighting, but no one's on my side (no one's on my side)
Fighting, but no one's on my side
I can't do this alone
Nowadays, I look over my shoulder
Paranoia eating at my mind
I don't know if I can take it much longer
Fighting and no one's on my side
To say how I've lost my way out
Nowadays I look over my shoulder
Fighting, but no one's on my side
Nowadays, I lie awake
Spend my nights talking to my ceiling (no one's on my side)
Keep to myself
I've always felt outnumbered
Spin my head around
I keep wondering who's out to get me
Cut my ties
Live my life in circles
