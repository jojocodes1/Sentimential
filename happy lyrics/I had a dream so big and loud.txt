I had a dream so big and loud
I jumped so high I touched the clouds
Whoa
Whoa
I stretched my hands out to the sky
We danced with monsters through the night
Whoa
Whoa

I'm never gonna look back
Whoa, never gonna give it up
No, please don't wake me now
(Two, three, four)

Whoo, whoo, whoo!
This is gonna be the best day of my life
My life
Whoo, whoo, whoo!
This is gonna be the best day of my life
My life

Whoo, whoo, whoo! (Whoo!)
Whoo, whoo, whoo!

I howled at the moon with friends
And then the sun came crashing in
Whoa
Whoa
But all the possibilities
No limits just epiphanies
Whoa
Whoa

I'm never gonna look back
Whoa, never gonna give it up
No, just don't wake me now

Whoo, whoo, whoo!
This is gonna be the best day of my life
My life
Whoo, whoo, whoo!
This is gonna be the best day of my life
My life

Whoo, whoo, whoo!
Whoo, whoo, whoo!

I hear it calling outside my window
I feel it in my soul (soul)
The stars were burning so bright
The sun was out 'til midnight
I say we lose control (control)

Whoo, whoo, whoo!
Whoo, whoo, whoo!

This is gonna be the best day of my life
My life
Whoo, whoo, whoo!
This is gonna be the best day of my life
My life

This is gonna be, this is gonna be, this is gonna be
The best day of my life
Everything is looking up, everybody up now
This is gonna be the best day of my life
My life
