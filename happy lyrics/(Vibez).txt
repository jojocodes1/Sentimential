(Vibez)
(But you knew that)
Oh-oh-oh
Ohh-oh-oh
Mmm-mmm
It's Ladipoe
(Let's go)
I like the way I'm feeling now
No come use your reggae spoil my blues and rhythm now, oh-oh-ohh
I like the way I'm feeling now
Omo, e get small thing wey dey stress me
But, right now, I'm chilling now, oh-oh-oh
Way out my feeling and nothing can stress me
The way I run the game, I'm feelin' like referee
No, like Moses partin' the Red Sea
Like a chauffeur, me, in the back of the Bentley
So I step out, all white, can't stain
What you want? Rosè? Champagne?
I got that, big bag, back pain
Takin' the piss, the only time I can't aim
So, we toast to the good life
Livin' every minute to the full 'cause I could die
Pull up at the spot, open door and it's suicide
Chilling rent free, where the cheque please?
Couple hundred Gs on a good night (but you knew that)
I like the way I'm feeling now
No come use your reggae spoil my blues and rhythm now, oh-oh-ohh
I like the way I'm feeling now
Omo, e get small thing wey dey stress me
But, right now, I'm chilling now, oh-oh-ohh
I like the way I'm feeling now
No come use your reggae spoil my blues and rhythm now, no-no-ohh
I like the way I'm feeling now
Omo, e get small thing wey dey stress me
But, right now, I'm chilling now, oh-oh-ohh
All I wanna do is jaiye
220 on a high way
I'm about the energy
Baby, if it's good, send it my way
If it's bad, keep it private
All these haters so vexed I'm the best alive
You don't want test the guy
You been sleepin' on yourselves, you tsetse fly
Throw myself a party then act surprised
And be the highest in the room when the guests arrive, yeah
Ain't nobody realer, touch down, got a couple Gs for the dealer
Gang signs out the window, my killer
Life gettin' sweeter, no use water dilute my Ribena
So, we toast to the good life
Every minute to the full 'cause we could die (could die)
Pull up, open door and it's suicide (suicide)
16 bad woop, and they all by the poolside (by the pool side)
I like the way I'm feeling now
No come use your reggae spoil my blues and rhythm now, oh-oh-ohh
I like the way I'm feeling now
Omo, e get small thing wey dey stress me
But, right now, I'm chilling now, oh-oh-ohh
I like the way I'm feeling now
No come use your reggae spoil my blues and rhythm now, no-no-ohh
I like the way I'm feeling now
Omo, e get small thing wey dey stress me
But, right now, I'm chilling now, oh-oh-ohh
With them boys, enough toys
Wey dey make noise, enough choice
You gats fear, when you see boys
Wey dey roll up in the nice toys
With them boys, wey dey make noise
Enough choice
You gats fear, when you see boys
Wey dey roll up in the nice toys
With them boys
I like the way I'm feeling now
No come use your reggae spoil my blues and rhythm now, oh-oh-ohh
I like the way I'm feeling now
Omo, e get small thing wey dey stress me
But, right now, I'm chilling now, oh-oh-ohh
